biased-text-sample
==================

by Joseph Turian


Make a biased sample of a large text corpus, based upon text in a smaller text corpus.
Essentially, Lucene index the large text corpus, and for each document
in the smaller corpus retrieve the top ten Lucene results.

Pipe a large stream of text into the indexer:
    /u/turian/data/web_corpus/WaCky2/sentencesplit.py  | ./index-sentences.py
